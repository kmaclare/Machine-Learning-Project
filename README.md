# Machine-Learning-Project

This is the project submission for the Coursera course on practical machine learning.  The goal of this project is to use data 
taken from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants to predict how a participant is performing a 
task.  One way is correct and the other four are common incorrect ways. More information is available from the website
